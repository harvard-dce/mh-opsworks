Delete the current matterhorn cluster

This undoes what `admin:cluster:init` does. It deletes:

* The app,
* The SNS topic and subscriptions
* The instances,
* The stack,
* Various IAM roles and policies specific to your cluster,
* The VPC infrastructure and NAT instance, and finally
* The cluster configuration files locally and stored remotely in the cluster
  configuration s3 bucket.

It is not reversible. Be careful!
