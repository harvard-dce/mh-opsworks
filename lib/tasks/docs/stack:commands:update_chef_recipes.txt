Update chef recipes on all instances

Update custom chef recipes on all instances in the cluster. The recipes used
are configured in the `custom_cookbooks_source` clause of your cluster
configuration:

      "custom_cookbooks_source": {
        "type": "git",
        "url": "https://github.com/harvard-dce/oc-opsworks-recipes",
        "revision": "branch,tag,or git SHA"
      }

You need to update the recipes when deploying new (or modified) recipes, or
when developing new ones.  Updating your recipes does not run them.
