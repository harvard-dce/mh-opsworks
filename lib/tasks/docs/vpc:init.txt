Create the cluster's VPC infrastructure via cloudformation

This will use the cluster's generated cloudformation template to create the
VPC infrastructure. This infrastructure includes:

* The VPC,
* Public and private subnets,
* A NAT instance glued to the private subnet with basic availability
  monitoring,
* **deprecated** If we're using EFS, the EFS mount automatically configured to connect to the
  instances.

This is generally done automatically - you'd only use this if you're
developing new features deployed via cloudformation.
