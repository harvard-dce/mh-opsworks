Sanity check your current cluster config

This runs a set of configuration checks to ensure your cluster config makes
sense. It looks for things like:

* Is there an admin layer?
* Is there a database layer?
* Is there no more than 1 admin or database instance?
* Are there EBS volumes on relevant layers to ensure we can persist data on
  scalable mount points?
* Is the cluster config valid JSON?
* Do we have a ganglia monitoring layer?

They aren't perfect and there are a million ways we can mess up a cluster -
but they do serve as a basic sanity check. This task is run automatically
before most others.
