Republish the maven cache to s3

This takes the maven cache from a currently running public instance (so
probably an admin or engage node), creates a tarball and then uploads that
tarball to the shared s3 asset bucket. This cache file is then used to build
the various AMIs, making deployment quicker and more robust.

This task is not something you use on a daily basis when managing a cluster,
it's something a super-admin updates once in a while.
