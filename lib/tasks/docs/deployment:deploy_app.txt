Deploy the main application

This will deploy the main application as configured in the cluster config to
all opencast layers - currently Admin, Engage, and Workers.

If the SHA resolved from the branch, tag, or revision has already been deployed
this does nothing and exits cleanly.

If you want to deploy a different branch, tag, or revision, use `cluster:edit`
and change the revision in the `app` section.

    "app_source": {
      "type": "git",
      "url": "git@your_git_url",
      "revision": "<your branch, tag or sha here>"
    }

This does not restart opencast after a deploy to allow you to spot check
and coordinate restarts more easily.  If the deploy fails on any node, rake
will exit. That means it's safe to to something like:

    ./bin/rake deployments:deploy_app opencast:restart

and if the deployment fails opencast will not be restarted and the previous
revision will still be running.
