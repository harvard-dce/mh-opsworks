Start all instances in the current cluster

Start instances in the proper order so that you end up with a correctly
running matterhorn application. This is what you should use to start a
cluster.

It takes 45 minutes to an hour to start a cluster the first time. This is
because we can't start them in parallel and because creating and formatting
EBS volumes is relatively expensive.

Subsequent starts go much faster, maybe 10 to 15 minutes.
