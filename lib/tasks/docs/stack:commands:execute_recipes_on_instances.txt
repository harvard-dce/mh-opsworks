Run chef recipes on specific instances by hostname

This allows you to run chef recipes on specific instances by their short
hostname.

This command will block until the recipes have run successfully on all hosts.
It will exit with some relevant errors in case of a failure. More information
is available in the AWS opsworks web UI, along with full error logs when an
execution fails.

EXAMPLES:

    ./bin/rake stack:commands:execute_recipes_on_instances recipes="recipe1,recipe1" hostnames="admin1,workers1"
