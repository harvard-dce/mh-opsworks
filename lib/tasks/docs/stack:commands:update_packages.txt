Update operating system packages

Installs regular operating system and package upgrades, not including kernel
updates. It runs "apt-get update" and "apt-get upgrade -y" under the covers,
which will install security and bugfix updates to packages. This should be
done during a deploy window just in case.

Recall that an LTS distribution will never increment a major or minor version
of a package unless you run "apt-get dist-upgrade", which will install new
versions of packages.
