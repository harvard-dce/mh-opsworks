Edit the current cluster config file in $EDITOR and sync afterwards

This wraps up a bunch of functionality and makes it easier and safer to edit
your current cluster config. It requires that you've got an editor configured
in your $EDITOR shell environment (see https://kb.iu.edu/d/acnc), typically by
updating your .bashrc or .bash_profile.

DO NOT EVER CHANGE A CLUSTER'S NAME. IT WILL CAUSE VERY BAD THINGS TO HAPPEN.

It opens the current cluster config in your $EDITOR of choice allowing you to
make changes.

After you save and exit, it:

* Runs 'cluster:configtest' to sanity check your config changes,
* Shows you a diff of the changes, allowing you to confirm them,
* Syncs the cluster config to the shared s3 bucket, and then
* Syncs the configuration to the connected AWS environment

It does not make every change implicit in your modifications (that would be
quite a bit of work). If you changed the app revision you'd need to redeploy -
if you changed users you'd need to run `stack:users:init` and so on.
