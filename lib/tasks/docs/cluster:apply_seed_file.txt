Remove and reset cluster database, files, and solr indexes and apply seed data

THIS IS DESTRUCTIVE. USE ONLY WHEN CERTAIN.

    ./bin/rake cluster:apply_seed_file seed_file="a_seed_file.tgz"

If you don't pass in a seed_file, you'll get a basic chooser that lets you
choose them by number.

This is most useful to allow you to restore a opencast cluster to a
consistent state based on the seed file you're applying.

It:

* Zeros out the files, database tables, and solr indexes on a cluster,
* Loads seed data from the cluster seed, and
* Ensures opencast is running.

The seed files live in the "shared_asset_bucket_name" configured in your
cluster config and are created by `cluster:create_seed_file`.
