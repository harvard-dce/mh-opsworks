Run chef recipes on instances in specific layers

This allows you to run chef recipes on all instances in the layers you
specify.  If you do not specify a layer, the recipes will be run on all
instances.

This command will block until the recipes have run successfully on all hosts.
It will exit with some relevant errors in case of a failure. More information
is available in the AWS opsworks web UI, along with full error logs when an
execution fails.

Use the full layer name. You can specify multiple comma-separated recipes.

EXAMPLES:

    # Runs on only Admin and Workers instances
    ./bin/rake stack:commands:execute_recipes_on_layers recipes="recipe1,recipe1" layers="Admin, Workers"

    # Runs on all instances
    ./bin/rake stack:commands:execute_recipes_on_layers recipes="recipe1,recipe1"
