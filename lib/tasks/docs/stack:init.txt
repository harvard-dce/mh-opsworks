Initialize a stack but not its dependents or dependencies

You probably want `admin:cluster:init`.

Create a stack within the associated VPC. It does not create the
layers, instances, app, or other associated resources. It is most useful for
oc-opsworks developers to create a stack when the supporting infrastructure is
already there.
