Create a cluster seed file

THIS IS WILL STOP A RUNNING OPENCAST. BE SURE TO USE THIS ONLY ON
NON-PRODUCTION CLUSTERS.

This creates a cluster seed file, which is a tarball that lets you
reproduce the state of a cluster in combination with other rake tasks. A
cluster seed files purpose is primarily to let you create a consistent
testing environment.

A cluster seed contains:

* A database dump,
* A manifest of hostnames to allow the database to be modified correctly after
  loading, and
* The video and image files.

The process of creating a cluster seed involves downtime. It's not meant as a
backup process.

The cluster seed is stored in `$SHARED_STORAGE_ROOT/cluster_seed`.  It is
uploaded to the configured `cluster_seed_bucket_name` after creation.
