Create and/or modify RDS event subscriptions

Event subscriptions are used to notify when RDS clusters go into/out of
certain states. When this happens, an alert is sent to the SNS topic the
subscription is bound to. By default, we watch for RDS failure and failover
events.

New clusters automatically get these event subscriptions - use this to add
event subscriptions to those clusters that don't have them bound to their RDS
instances.
