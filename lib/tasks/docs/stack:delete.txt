Delete a stack with no dependencies

You probably want `admin:cluster:delete`.

You must delete all dependent resources - layers, instances, apps, etc. before
you can delete a stack with this task. This is only useful to mh-opsworks
developers to help iterate on stack creation without spinning up all the
infrastructure under it.
