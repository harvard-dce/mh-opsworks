Update the users and rights in the current cluster

This reinitializes the users and rights in the current cluster according to
what's configured in your "users" JSON stanza. You must run this after editing
your users via `cluster:edit` to have the changes actually take effect.

If a user doesn't exist, they'll be created. If they do exist and their rights
change their rights will be updated. If you modify the SSH key, that key will
be modified as well.

This runs on every node in a cluster and can take a few minutes.
