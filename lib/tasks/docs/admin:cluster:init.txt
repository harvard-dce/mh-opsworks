Initialize a opencast cluster using the current cluster config

This:

* Creates the VPC and NAT infrastructure via a cloudformation template,
* Creates the RDS Aurora cluster infrastructure via a cloudformation template,
* Creates the opsworks stack, layers, and instances, gluing everything
  together correctly within the VPC, and
* Creates the opsworks application that'll be deployed.

It DOES NOT start instances. It just creates the
infrastructure and the opsworks "stub" records that define your cluster.

After this task, you may want to run `stack:instances:start` to actually start
your cluster.
