SSH to a public or private instance in the current stack

Create an SSH command with the proper key forwarding and SSH chaining to allow
you to connect to both public and private instances in your cluster.

It uses your defaultly configured ssh key, which (if you used `cluster:new`)
should already be added to the cluster - check your cluster configuration via
`cluster:edit`.

By default, the ssh username is your current login username (so, the value of $USER).
You can override this by passing in `ssh_user`.

Example invocations:

    ./bin/rake stack:instances:ssh_to hostname=hostname
    ./bin/rake stack:instances:ssh_to ssh_user=dancp hostname=admin1

If you wrap this command in $(), it'll actually execute the generated SSH
command and (if everything is set up properly) get you into the cluster.
Example:

    $(./bin/rake stack:instances:ssh_to hostname=admin1)
    $(./bin/rake stack:instances:ssh_to hostname=workers1)
