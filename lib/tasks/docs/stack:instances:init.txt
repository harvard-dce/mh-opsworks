Initialize instances in every layer of the current stack

Use this after your edit your layer instance configurations to apply those
changes to the currently active cluster.

So, for instance, if you update a layer to have 5 instead of 2 instances,
you'd run this to actually create the "stub" opsworks instances. Then you'd
run `stack:instances:start` to actually start the instances (or let your
horizontal scaling mechanism handle it).

This isn't smart enough to do difficult things, like apply partition or
network changes against running instances.
