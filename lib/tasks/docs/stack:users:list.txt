List user rights in the current stack

You control user rights to your stack by editing your cluster config via
`cluster:edit` and adding a user's SSH key to it.

Most users can at least "show" a stack - this right is necessary to allow for
some intra-stack coordination on things like names.

cluster:edit, stack:users:init
