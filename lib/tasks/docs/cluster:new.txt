Initialize and switch into a new cluster

Create a new opsworks cluster. You'll be prompted to answer a few questions
allowing you to choose:

* A name (which must be unique - we'll check for you!),
* An appropriate size or "variant" for your cluster, and
* The URL and branch, tag, or revision of the application you're deploying.

NAMING SUGGESTIONS:

<your initials> <2 to 4 word feature description> <ticket number>

DO NOT EVER CHANGE A CLUSTER'S NAME. IT WILL CAUSE VERY BAD THINGS TO HAPPEN.

Cluster names can be pretty big (255 char) and should be descriptive, but
don't go nuts. We'll inflect on the cluster name to ensure all resources we
create can easily be traced back to this cluster.

After the initial questions are answered successfully, the config will be
created and uploaded to the `cluster_config_bucket_name` s3 bucket as
configured in your `secrets.json` file.

You'll also be switched into the cluster you just created so that you can run
`admin:cluster:init`.

SSH CONFIG:

We'll find your default ssh key and fill in a user account that matches your
current username - this should make ssh'ing into your new cluster easier. You
probably want to share the same ssh key on all machines you work from.
