Force deploy the most recent app revision

This recipe allows you to test deployments when working on chef recipes.

This is similar to `deployment:deploy_app` except it forces the deployment
recipes to run on every opencast node no matter what.

This recipe potentially involves extended downtime to opencast and should
only be used in development or staging clusters.
