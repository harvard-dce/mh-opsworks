List recent deployments and chef commands

In opsworks land, a "deployment" is a chef recipe run or a stack command.

A stack command is a built-in chef recipe that:

* Updates the chef recipes for a stack,
* Updates OS packages, or
* Changes the users with rights to a cluster (among other tasks).

This task lists deployments, chef recipe runs, and stack commands that've been
executed against a cluster. You can see similar output in the opsworks AWS web
UI under "Deployments."
