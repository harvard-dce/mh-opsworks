Sync the current cluster config with the remote configuration

This will ensure the active cluster config is up-to-date with the remote,
authoritative one. The authoritative config is stored in the
`cluster_config_bucket_name` s3 bucket as configured in your `secrets.json`.

If the local copy is ahead, you'll be prompted to review and then save the
changes. If the local copy is behind, it'll be updated.

This rake task is run automatically before most others to ensure you're not
managing a cluster based on a stale config.
