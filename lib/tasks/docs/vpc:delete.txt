Delete the stack's VPC

Hi. This is dangerous. This will delete the cloudformation stack that created
the current cluster's VPC infrastructure. The VPC exists outside of opsworks,
you could totally b0rk a cluster by removing its VPC from underneath it.

VPCs are generally removed automatically - you'd only use this if you're
developing new features deployed via cloudformation.
